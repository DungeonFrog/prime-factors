# prime-factors
An exercise in python to generate the prime factorization of an integer greater than 1.

Define a python procedure which prompts the user for a number and then prints the prime factors of that argument.

For example, if the user enters 21, the program will print 3, 7  (or 7, 3).  If the user enters 12, the program will print 2, 2, 3 (or 2, 3, 2) etc. If the user enters a prime number, the program will print just the prime number.
